# AI-Powered PDF Analysis and Insights Platform üöÄ

This repository contains the source code for an **AI-powered platform** developed for the **Adobe India Hackathon Final Round**. The application transforms the way users interact with PDF documents by allowing users to **upload multiple PDFs**, analyze their content using **state-of-the-art AI models**, and extract **insights, summaries, and even generate podcasts** from selected text.  

Designed for **researchers, students, and professionals**, this tool helps quickly understand and synthesize information from multiple documents. Leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, it goes beyond simple keyword searches to provide a **deep, contextual understanding** of the content, highlighting relevant sections and generating actionable insights.


## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The application is built with a modern, decoupled architecture, consisting of a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. The diagram below illustrates the high-level architecture of the system:

- Perform **semantic search** across all uploaded PDFs.  
- Retrieve **relevant sections** based on contextual similarity rather than exact keywords.  
- Support **fast and efficient similarity computations** for real-time user queries.  
- Maintain **small memory footprint** while providing high accuracy for sentence-level embeddings.
